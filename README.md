# Rockbuster-SQL
A presentation based on data analysis was prepared for the Management Board in order to address the business inquiries. The technical team was provided with a data dictionary and SQLs to assist in answering the crucial questions.
## Objective

Within this project, my responsibility involves analyzing sales patterns and customer behaviors for Instacart. The objective is to discover valuable insights that can enhance customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Questions

Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

What was the average rental duration for all videos?

Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Tools

Rockbuster utilized the Rockbuster relational database management system and Postgre SQL for the purpose of conducting analysis. The dataset encompasses a wide range of information, including details about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, films, actors, rental history, and addresses.
